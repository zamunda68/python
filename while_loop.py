# while loop is something that is done until certain condition is met

# A simple variable below
i = 1
# while condition. The condition itself is "i <= 10:"
while i <= 10:
# What this will do is to keep looping through the code, until "i" is equal or below 10
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
print("Condition met, loop ended")
